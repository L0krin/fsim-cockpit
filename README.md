# Flight Simulator Cockpit Build
I'm building a low budget flight simulator home cockpit. I'll be documenting the progress through my website. This repository will be primarily for the website source code, but also for the various code snippets and other materials for the site and build.

## What I'm doing
The plan is to replicate the cockpit of a Cessna 172 as closely as possible, but more importantly as cheap as possible. That being said there will be times when I have to sacrifice authenticity to be able to do things cheaper. Most of the cockpit will be setup using Arduino boards and I'll be 3-D printing as many parts as possible. I'm building the website for a class I'm currently in, so some of the website decisions will be guided by that fact.
