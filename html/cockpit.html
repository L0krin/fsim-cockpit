<h2>Background:</h2>
<p>
    A few years ago I got an Arduino and had a lot of fun playing around with it creating various circuits. After awhile 
    I ended up wanting to make permanent projects that I would keep together so I ended up buying 5 Pro Micro boards on ebay.
    Then after a couple years I got busy with school and raising my son, so they ended up collecting dust. I'm now in my 
    senior year, and I plan on earning my pilot's license after graduation. I have a flight yoke and rudder pedals, 
    but clicking around the virtual cockpit is getting old. I recently bought a 3D printer, so that really pulled me back 
    into the world of small electronics. So after doing some research and modeling I found some useful sites to help me bring 
    this project to life.
</p>
<h2>Parts:</h2>
<p>
    I already have the flight yoke and rudder pedals, but I really wanted some more realism. So one day I was browsing
    <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com">Thingiverse</a> for something to print with my printer and I ended up searching "Flight Simulator".
    The first result was an <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2473812">Attitude Indicator</a> which caught my attention because I 
    initially thought "How would they do such a thing with a 3D printer?" so as I started reading into creating it, I started slipping deeper
    into the rabbit hole. 
    <br>
    Just after that search I've already got the following gauges on my list of things to print:<br>
    <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2473812">Attitude Indicator</a>,<br>
    <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2489322">3.5" Gauge</a>,<br>
    <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2613145">Turn Coordinator</a>,<br>
    I still need to find an altitude indicator and compass, but those will keep my printer busy for a little while. In the meantime I ordered
    some SG90 servos so I can build the gauges when they finish printing.

<h2>The Project:</h2>
<p>
    At this point I had my project in mind. I wanted to build a flight simulator cockpit, but I know how fast this can turn into a money pit,
    so I'm calling it a "budget cockpit"...whatever that means. Essentially the idea is that I will build a cockpit as cheap as I can using 
    what I have or can get cheap. Luckily having a 3D printer makes things a lot easier. I'm willing to sacrifice authenticity where necessary 
    in order to cut costs. In the end it will never be like the real thing, but I expect a little more realism can only help my quest for a 
    private pilot's license. So I came up with a basic list of what I want to start with:
</p>
<ul>
        <li>Keep the cost low, some authenticity will be sacrificed to cut costs.</li>
        <li>Compatible with X-Plane 11 simulator.</li>
        <li>Use as much free and open-source software and hardware as possible.</li>
        <li>Document progress, and provide links and files so that anyone who may want to replicate the cockpit can.</li>
        <li>If licensing allows, keep a repository of all the files I used so that they can be preserved.</li>
        <li>Keep a log of whats been done, and what I'm currently working on.</li>
        <li>Provide a list of future additions.</li>
        <li>Include Pictures, Videos, and Timelapses of the build process.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Goal:</h2>
<p>
    The primary goal here is to create an environment where I can practice for flight training. I also like to play with 
    <a href="http://www.fseconomy.net/welcome">FSEconomy</a> which adds a lot of depth to the flight simulator. Trying to conserve fuel 
    and make as much money as possible makes flying much more fun. I used to spend hours just practicing pattern work and flying around 
    practicing manuvers and then landings. Soon I'll have owned X-Plane 11 for a year, in that time I've logged over 40 hours of flight 
    time, but of those 40 only 1-2 were actually cross-country flights, and I had no idea how to navigate. I've been playing FSEconomy 
    for a week and have already learned a lot and logged several hours of cross-country flight. For anyone who enjoys flight but is bored 
    just flying around the airport, I highly recommend FSEconomy. Oh by the way, 
    <a href="https://bitbucket.org/Airboss/fseconomy">FSEconomy is free and open-source.</a><br>
