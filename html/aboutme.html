<h1>About Me</h1>
<br>
<p title="A bit about me.">
    I am in my senior year working on my bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
    I like working with computers and small electronics, but I also plan to get my private pilot's license after graduation.
    So I figured I would combine all of the above and build myself a home cockpit to play flight simulator.

    I'm a big supporter of Open-Source hardware and software, this website is hosted using CentOS, Docker CE, and Apache.
