<p>
    This website is being built as part of an assignment in one of my classes.
    I needed to build a website, and also wanted to document the build process of my simulator, so I'm doing both.
    Here I will be documenting the build process of my home-built cockpit for X-Plane 11.
    I'll be documenting what I have done up until this point, and include plans for the future.

    I just got the webserver running so it might be a little while before content is available.
    Because this site is being built as part of a class, it will probably be improving over time.
