          This website is being built as part of an assignment in one of my classes.
          I needed to build a website, and also wanted to document the build process of my simulator, so I'm doing both.
          Here I will be documenting the build process of my home-built cockpit for X-Plane 11.
          I'll be documenting what I have done up until this point, and include plans for the future.<br><br>
          Landing instant replay from my test flight after configuring the switches:
      </p>
      <video width="800" controls>
          <source src="images/LandingReplay.mp4" type="video/mp4">
          Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
      </video>
      <p>
        I know I could have recorded and uploaded the raw video rather than record the computer screen with my phone...maybe I will next time.<br>
        Go check out my <a href="currentstate.html">status</a> page to see what I've built so far.

          I just got the webserver running so it might be a little while before content is available.
          Because this site is being built as part of a class, it will probably be improving over time.
